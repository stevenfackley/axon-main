# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the **Axon** project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the project and the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

**Examples of unacceptable behavior:**

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwanted sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Introducing code that intentionally violates the project's zero-knowledge privacy principles (e.g., adding cloud telemetry disguised as a feature)
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

---

## Project-Specific Standards

Because Axon handles sensitive biometric data, we hold contributors to an additional standard:

- **Never include real biometric data in issues, PRs, or test fixtures.** Use synthetic or randomly generated data only.
- **Never advocate for removing privacy-protecting features** (audit logging, encryption decorators, air-gap mode).
- **Respect the zero-knowledge architecture.** PRs that attempt to introduce cloud dependencies or analytics SDKs are not a technical disagreement — they are a fundamental violation of the project's mission.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, and any other official communication channel. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

---

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening a private discussion or contacting the project maintainer directly through GitHub. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

---

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional.  
**Consequence:** A private, written warning with clarity around the nature of the violation. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.  
**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.  
**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the project.

### 4. Permanent Ban

## Changes Made

<!-- List the specific files and what changed in each. -->

## Architecture Boundary Check

- [ ] `Axon.Core` does **not** reference `Axon.Infrastructure` or `Axon.UI`.
- [ ] All new I/O and external calls are in `Axon.Infrastructure`.
- [ ] No business logic was added to `Axon.UI`.

## Security & Privacy Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded keys, salts, or connection strings were introduced.
- [ ] No third-party telemetry, analytics, or crash-reporting SDK was added.
- [ ] All new domain `ToString()` methods mask biometric `Value` fields.
- [ ] All new repositories are decorated with `AuditLoggingDecorator` and `EncryptionDecorator`.
- [ ] `IHardwareVault` is used for any new cryptographic key derivation.

## Performance & Memory

- [ ] No `dynamic` types or reflection introduced (breaks Native AOT).
- [ ] Hot-path ingestion loops use `Span<T>` / `ArrayPool<T>` — no per-event heap allocations.
- [ ] Data requests spanning >24 hours route through `LttbDownsampler`.
- [ ] UI thread is never blocked (heavy work dispatched via `Task.Run`).

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `dotnet build` — zero warnings.
- [ ] `dotnet test` — all tests pass.
- [ ] AOT publish: `dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release /p:PublishAot=true` — succeeds.
- [ ] New `NormalizationMapper` has **100% unit test coverage** (if applicable).
- [ ] Memory profiling shows zero hot-path heap allocations (if touching ingestion).
- [ ] `docs/` updated for any new `IBiometricDriver` or architectural change.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated under `[Unreleased]`.

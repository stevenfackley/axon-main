## Feature Summary

<!-- A clear, one-sentence description of the feature. -->

## Problem / Motivation

<!--
What problem does this solve? What user need or architectural gap does it address?
Example: "As a user with both a Whoop and a Garmin, I cannot currently compare HRV data side-by-side because..."
-->

## Proposed Solution

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. Be as specific as possible. -->

## Alternative Approaches Considered

<!-- Describe any alternative solutions or features you've considered and why you prefer your proposed approach. -->

## Architecture Impact

<!--
Which layers of the Axon architecture would this touch?
- [ ] Axon.Core (domain model, ports)
- [ ] Axon.Infrastructure (adapters, persistence, ML)
- [ ] Axon.UI (views, view models, rendering)
- [ ] Cross-cutting (security, CI, docs)
-->

## Sovereignty & Privacy Check

<!--
All features must pass this check before consideration:
-->

- [ ] This feature does NOT introduce cloud telemetry, analytics, or third-party tracking.
- [ ] This feature does NOT require biometric data to leave the device (or if it does, it uses zero-knowledge encryption).
- [ ] This feature is compatible with Native AOT (no reflection-heavy dependencies).
- [ ] This feature respects the Air-Gap mode (can operate fully offline).

## Acceptance Criteria

<!--
How will we know this feature is complete? List specific, testable conditions.
Example:
- Given a Garmin device is connected, when the user navigates to Dashboard, then HRV data appears normalized in the ACS format.
- The NormalizationMapper for this source has 100% unit test coverage.
